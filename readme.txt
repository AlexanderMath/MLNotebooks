This repository will contain code from many of my different projects. The projects range from hobbies, teaching to research. I will attempt to make IPython Notebooks that explain minimal working .. 


TODO:

See if I can make readme file a IPython Notebook, and maybe add an example of how minimal working example for each project is.
