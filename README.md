This repository contains material I co-authored when I was teaching assistant for the Machine Learning course at Aarhus University. 
The material has changed since, however, the material in "AU ML course/exam help/" might be useful with the educational videos I made at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2lpCkCFv1z3tdoh-moiAgg/playlists" target="_blank">youtube</a>.
